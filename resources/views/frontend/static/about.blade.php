            </p>
            <p>From the initial days of starting the project, the main aim of FoodMOOD was very clear and it was to connect the foodies with the healthy cuisines which are made by home based chefs. As we all know, food delivery is very popular among all of us and at some point of time we all think if it is really healthy as we would cook at home. There might be many things that customers might not know about how fast food industry works and how unhealthy their burger or fries might be. However, with FoodMOOD we aim to provide our customers with highly nutritious food items which obviously will be cooked in small batches as someone would cook at home.
