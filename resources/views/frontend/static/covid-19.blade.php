	<p>Our top priority is to ensure customers get healthy and controlled food with regards to Coronavirus/COVID-19.
	To ensure, we are strictly complying with the government requirements for food safety and COVID-19. Each of staff are regularly trained and are actively following health and safety guidelines in the following criterias as parts of the requirements:
	</p><br>

	<h5>Food Safety Control:</h5>
	<ul class="text-secondary" style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>keeping hot food hot then cool as quickly as possible for storage
		</li>
		<li>keeping cold food below 5°C</li>
		<li>monitoring temperature with thermometers in the oven and refrigerator</li>
		<li>controlling temperatures during transport</li>
		<li>not re-using food containers and other materials if they are not rated for multiple uses by the manufacturer</li>
		<li>maintaining hygiene with frequent, adequate hand washing</li><br>

		<h5>Labeling:</h5>
		<ul class="text-secondary" style="list-style-type:disc">
			<li>name of the food</li>
			<li>directions for use and storage</li>
			<li>production 'lot' of the food prepared under the same conditions during a span of time</li>
			<li>name and street address in Australia or New Zealand of the supplier of the food</li>
			<li>list of ingredients</li>
			<li>‘best before’ or ‘use-by’ marking as appropriate to the product</li><br>

			<h5>Internal Audit:</h5>

				<li>food handling controls: storage, display and transport, processing, the risk of cross-contamination </li>
				<li>cleaning and sanitising, hand washing and proximity of facilities </li>

		<h5>Food Safety Supervisor (FSS):</h5>
		<p>The Food Act 2003 (NSW) requires certain food businesses in the NSW hospitality and retail food service sector to have at least one trained Food Safety Supervisor. Our qualified FSSs inspects the premises to review their operation and consider what other measures should be implemented further in order to reduce the impact of COVID-19.</p>
